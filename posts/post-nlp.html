      <h2>Machine Learning for Natural Language Processing</h2>
      <p><em>April 20, 2024</em></p>

      <p>Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a rapidly evolving subfield of artificial intelligence that focuses on the interaction between computers and human language. Machine learning has become central to NLP, enabling systems to automatically learn rules and patterns from large text corpora.</p>

      <p>This post explores several core approaches to NLP using machine learning:</p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Word Embeddings:</strong> Techniques like Word2Vec and GloVe map words to dense vector representations that capture semantic meaning.</li>
        <li><strong>Sequence Models:</strong> Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), LSTMs, and GRUs handle sequences of text for tasks like translation and sentiment analysis.</li>
        <li><strong>Transformer Models:</strong> Architectures like BERT and GPT revolutionized NLP by enabling parallel training and contextual understanding.</li>
        <li><strong>Fine-tuning Pre-trained Models:</strong> Transfer learning allows developers to adapt large pre-trained models to specific tasks with minimal data.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>The field continues to grow with the development of multilingual models, few-shot learning, and ethical frameworks for responsible language model deployment.</p>
